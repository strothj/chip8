  "description": "13. VIP Biorhythm\r\n\r\nThe theory of Biorhythm states that there are thre predominant cycles that can influence\r\nhuman behavior.  These include a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle and a\r\n33-day intellectual cycle.  All three cycles start at birth and continue throughout life.\r\n\r\nEach cycle consists of a positive and a negative period.  Physical, Emotional and\r\nIntellectual aspects are enhanced during positive periods.  Poor performance is\r\nindicated by the negative period of a cycle.\r\n\r\nA critical day occurs on the crossover from the positive to the negative period or\r\nvice versa.  A critical day indicates instability in a particular aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Use VIP Biorhythm\r\n\r\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\r\n   the game starting at 0200.\r\n\r\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\r\n\r\n3. Enter birthdate using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year.\r\n\r\n4. Enter start date using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year. The start date\r\n   indicates the first day of the 32-day Biorhythm chart the program will generate.\r\n\r\n5. After a period of calculation proportional to the span of time involved, the three\r\n   cycle curves will be shown for a 32-day period.  Each horizontal bit position\r\n   represents one day in the cycle.  The start day, on the left, and every seventh\r\n   day are indicated by week markers.  The first day of a positive or negative period\r\n   is a critical day.\r\n\r\n6. To advance the start date, hold key F down until the desired date is reached.\r\n   To decrement the start date, hold key B down.  These functions allow changing the\r\n   start date slightly without reentering all the dates and waiting for the calculations\r\n   to be preformed.\r\n  \r\n7. Press Key 0 to clear the screen and enter a new set of dates.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n   See VIPG1-13.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tPhysical\t\tEmotional\t\tIntellectual\r\n\r\nPositive Period\t\tStrong, \t\tGood moods, \t\tGood Judgement\r\n(Up)\t\t\tVigorous\t\tCooperative\t\tSharp Mentally\r\n\r\nNegative Period\t\tTire easily,\t\tLow Enthusiasm,\t\tLow attentiveness\r\n(Down)\t\t\tLess Stamina\t\tFeelings Subdued\tand concentration\r\n\r\nCritical Days\t\tSusceptible to injury\temotionally unstable,\tPoor memory,\r\n(Crossover)\t\tor Illness,\t\tUpset easily\t\tProne to mistakes\r\n\t\t\tLow endurance\r\n"
