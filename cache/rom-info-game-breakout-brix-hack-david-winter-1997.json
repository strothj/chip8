  "description": "Breakout (Brix hack), by: David Winter\r\n\r\nThis game is an \"arkanoid\" precursor. You have 5 lives, and your goal is the destruction of all the brixs. Use 4 and 6 to move your paddle. The game ends when all the brixs are destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis game is the same than BRIX, but has graphics looking like the game on the Atari 2600 console.\r\n\r\n"
