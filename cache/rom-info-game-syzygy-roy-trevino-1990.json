  "description": "SYZYGY v0.1\r\n\r\nOne of the first games I remember playing on a computer was \r\ncalled \"syzygy\" on a now ancient TRS-80 Model 1.  It has since\r\nappeared on other computers under various names.  Why it was\r\ncalled syzygy, I have no idea (consult Websters).  However, since\r\nthe HP48SX has approximately the same memory, graphics and cpu\r\npower as my TRS-80 did (something like 16kB, 128x64, and a 1.2Mhz Z80),\r\nI thought it would be amusing to play it again.  Now, approximately\r\nto my recollection, and with many apologies to the original author,\r\nhere is a CHIP48 version of SYZYGY.  Enough drivel.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to seek out \"targets\".  You do this with\r\nyour syzygy.  Initially small, the syzygy will grow by some amount\r\neach time a target is hit.  Eventually, your syzygy will\r\nbe so long as to make tougher and tougher to get any points (and easier\r\nand easier to get killed).  Confused?  Just try it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, the syzygy is not allowed to run into anything except targets.\r\nIt cannot run into the screen border (if present), or itself (this \r\nincludes backing into itself).  Fast and immediate death will result.\r\nDon't worry if you die quickly a few times.  The keys take a few \r\nminutes to get used to.\r\n\r\nTo start:     +      start/restart game with border\r\n              -      start/restart borderless game\r\n       \r\nTo play:      9      up\r\n              6      down\r\n              1      left\r\n              2      right\r\n\r\n[Hint for frustrated beginners: hold left hand on 1 & 2, and right hand on\r\n 6 & 9 keys.  Alternate between left hand, right hand, left hand...  -jkh-]\r\n\r\n\r\nFine print (borrowed from Andreas Gustafsson, author of CHIP-48):\r\n\r\n  SYZYGY is (c) copyright 1990 by Roy Trevino (RTT)\r\n\r\n  Noncommercial distribution allowed, provided that this\r\n  copyright message is preserved, and any modified versions\r\n  are clearly marked as such.\r\n\r\n  SYZYGY, via CHIP-48, makes use of undocumented low-level features\r\n  of the HP48SX calculator, and may or may not cause loss of data,\r\n  excessive battery drainage, and/or damage to the calcultor\r\n  hardware.
