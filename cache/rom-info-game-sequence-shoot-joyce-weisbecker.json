Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\r\n   the game starting at 0200.\r\n\r\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\r\n\r\n3. Pressing the Key C causes the little man to shoot the top target, Key D shoots the\r\n   one below it, Key E the next lower and Key F the bottom target.\r\n\r\n4. One of the four targets flashes and the computer waits for you to shoot it.  When\r\n   you press teh correct key, you get one point.  Then two flash, on after the other.\r\n   Shoot the one that flashed first, then shoot the other.  This gives you two more\r\n   points.  Three targets (when hit in the same order as they flashed) add three\r\n   points to your score.\r\n\r\n5. Each time you shoot such a series of targets in proper sequence, your score\r\n   increases by the number of targets you hit.  An the next series you see is longer\r\n   by one target.  The maximum length of sequence is 22 targets, that is a score of 254.\r\n\r\n6. Improper sequencing of shots in any series ends the game."
