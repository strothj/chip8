  "description": "Craps, by: Camerlo Cortez\r\n\r\nTo use the Craps program, press any key to roll dice.\r\n7 or 11 wins, 12, 2 or 3 loses on first roll. The second roll must match the first to win, but if you roll a seven you lose. This program could be expanded to include on-the-screen scoring of bets.\r\n"
