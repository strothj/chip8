  "description": "5. VIP SLIDE\r\n\r\nSlide is a two-person game.  Each player tries to slide a \"puck\" over the high-scoring\r\n\"spots\" without hitting the back wall.\r\n\r\nHow To Play VIP Slide\r\n\r\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpretor at 0000-01FF\r\n   and the game starting at 0200.\r\n\r\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\r\n\r\n3. The puck moves up and down randomly.  Press \"0\" key to stop the puck.  The puck\r\n   will move towards the spots after you release the key.  The longer you hold the\r\n   key down, the further the puck travels (maximum time approximately 2.5 seconds).\r\n\r\n4. You get 2 points for hitting the first spot, 4 points for either of the next two\r\n   spots and 8 points for either of the last two.  The highest score possible is 216\r\n   (two spots can be hit on one slide).\r\n\r\n5. If you hit the back wall, though, you get zero points for that slide, even though\r\n   you've hit a spot.\r\n\r\n6. Each player gets 3 pucks per turn and 6 turns in a game.\r\n"
