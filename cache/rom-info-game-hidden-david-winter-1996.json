It is very simple to play.\r\n\r\nThe rules are as follow: your goal is to find all the identical cards\r\nin a minimum time.\r\n\r\nYou are playing in a 4*4 card grid. You can see only two cards at the\r\nsame time. Once this time passed, these two cards will remain shown\r\nif they are identical, otherwise they will be hidden again.\r\n\r\nWhen the game is finished, two scores are shown:\r\n        SC is your score, corresponding to the number of tries\r\n        HI is the best score (smallest number of tries made to finish)\r\n\r\nThe keys are:\r\n\r\n        [2] : More DOWN\r\n        [4] : Move LEFT\r\n        [5] : Show card\r\n        [6] : Move RIGHT\r\n        [8] : Move UP\r\n\r\nEnjoy !!!\r\n"
