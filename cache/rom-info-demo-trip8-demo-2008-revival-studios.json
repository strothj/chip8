The demo consists of an intro, 3D vectorballs, and 4 randomized dot-effects.  \r\n\r\nWriting a demo for the original Chip-8 interpreter was a real pain, since your framerate basically drops in half for every sprite you need to draw. So even clearing and redrawing a few dots will cause the framerate to drop to near zero :) Originally the demo was going to be bigger and there were much more graphical effects programmed/prototyped, but a lot of these effects turned out to be too much for the original unoptimized Chip-8 interpreters to handle. \r\n\r\nRunning the Demo:\r\n-----------------\r\nUse the Megachip emulator or any other Chip-8/SuperChip compatible emulator to run the slideshow.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n--------\r\nProgramming/Graphics/Design by: Martijn Wenting\r\n\r\nDistribution:\r\n-------------\r\nThis package can be freely distributed in its original form.\r\nIf you would like to include this slideshow in your rom package, please let me know.\r\n\r\nWatch out for more releases soon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMartijn Wenting / Revival Studios\r\n\r\n"
